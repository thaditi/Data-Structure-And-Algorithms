# Binary tree traversals

## Problem Introduction:

In this problem you will implement in-order, pre-order and post-order traversals of a binary tree.

## Task:

You are given a rooted binary tree. Build and output its in-order, pre-order and post-order traversals.

## Input Format:

The first line contains the number of vertices 𝑛. The vertices of the tree are numbered
from 0 to 𝑛 − 1. Vertex 0 is the root.
The next 𝑛 lines contain information about vertices 0, 1, ..., 𝑛−1 in order. Each of these lines contains three integers 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 — 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖 is the key of the 𝑖-th vertex, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 is the index of the left child of the 𝑖-th vertex, and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 is the index of the right child of the 𝑖-th vertex. If 𝑖 doesn’t have left or right child (or both), the corresponding 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 or 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 (or both) will be equal to −1.

## Constraints:

1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>; 0 ≤ 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖 ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>; −1 ≤ 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖, 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1. It is guaranteed that the input represents a valid binary tree. In particular, if 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 ̸= −1 and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 ̸= −1, then 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 ̸= 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖.
Also, a vertex cannot be a child of two different vertices. Also, each vertex is a descendant of the root vertex.

## Output Format:

Print three lines. The first line should contain the keys of the vertices in the in-order
traversal of the tree. The second line should contain the keys of the vertices in the pre-order traversal of the tree. The third line should contain the keys of the vertices in the post-order traversal of the tree.

## Sample:

```
Input:
5
4 1 2
2 3 4
5 -1 -1
1 -1 -1
3 -1 -1
Output:
1 2 3 4 5
4 2 1 3 5
1 3 2 5 4

```
