# Check brackets in the code

## Problem Introduction:

In this problem you will implement a feature for a text editor to find errors in the usage of brackets in the code.

## Input Format:

Input contains one string 𝑆 which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, punctuation
marks and brackets from the set []{}().

## Constraints:

The length of 𝑆 is at least 1 and at most 10<sup>5</sup>.

## Output Format:

If the code in 𝑆 uses brackets correctly, output “Success" (without the quotes). Otherwise,
output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there are no unmatched closing
brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.

## Sample:

```
Input:
{[]}()
Output:
Success

```
