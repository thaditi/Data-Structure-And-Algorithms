## Problem Introduction:

In this problem, you will design and implement an elementary greedy algorithm
used by cashiers all over the world millions of times per day.

## Task:

The goal in this problem is to find the minimum number of coins needed to change the input value
(an integer) into coins with denominations 1, 5, and 10.

## Input Format:

The input consists of a single integer 𝑚.

## Constraints:

1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>.

## Output Format:

Output the minimum number of coins with denominations 1, 5, 10 that changes 𝑚.

## Sample:

```
Input:
28
Output:
6
```

10+10+5+1+1+1=28 (6)
