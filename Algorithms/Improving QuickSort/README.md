# Improving Quick Sort

## Problem Introduction:

The goal in this problem is to redesign a given implementation of the randomized
quick sort algorithm so that it works fast even on sequences containing
many equal elements.

## Task:

To force the given implementation of the quick sort algorithm to efficiently process sequences with
few unique elements, your goal is replace a 2-way partition with a 3-way partition. That is, your new
partition procedure should partition the array into three parts: < 𝑥 part, = 𝑥 part, and > 𝑥 part.

## Input Format:

The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑛. The next line contains a sequence of 𝑛 integers 𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛−1.

## Constraints:

1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>; 0 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 10<sup>9</sup> for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛.

## Output Format:

Output this sequence sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Sample:

```
Input:
5
2 3 9 2 2

Output:
2 2 2 3 9

```
