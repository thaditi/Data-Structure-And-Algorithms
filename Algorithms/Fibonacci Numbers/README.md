# Fibonacci Number

## Problem Introduction:

Recall the definition of Fibonacci sequence: 𝐹0 = 0, 𝐹1 = 1, and 𝐹𝑖 = 𝐹𝑖−1 +𝐹𝑖−2 for
𝑖 ≥ 2. Your goal in this problem is to implement an efficient algorithm for computing
Fibonacci numbers.

## Task:

Given an integer 𝑛, find the 𝑛th Fibonacci number 𝐹𝑛.

## Input Format:

The input consists of a single integer 𝑛.

## Constraints:

0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 45.

## Output Format:

Output 𝐹𝑛.

## Sample:

```
Input:
10

Output:
55

```
