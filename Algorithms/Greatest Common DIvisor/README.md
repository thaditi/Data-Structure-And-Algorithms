# Greatest Common Divisor

## Problem Introduction:

The greatest common divisor GCD(𝑎, 𝑏) of two non-negative integers 𝑎 and 𝑏
(which are not both equal to 0) is the greatest integer 𝑑 that divides both 𝑎 and 𝑏.
Your goal in this problem is to implement the Euclidean algorithm for computing
the greatest common divisor.

## Task:

Given two integers 𝑎 and 𝑏, find their greatest common divisor.

## Input Format:

The two integers 𝑎, 𝑏 are given in the same line separated by space.

## Constraints:

1 ≤ 𝑎, 𝑏 ≤ 2 · 10<sup>9</sup>.

## Output Format:

Output GCD(𝑎, 𝑏).

## Sample:

```
Input:
18 35

Output:
1

```

18 and 35 do not have common non-trivial divisors.
