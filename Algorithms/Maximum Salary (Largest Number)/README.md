# Maximum Salary

## Problem Introduction:

As the last question of a successful interview, your boss gives you a few pieces of paper
with numbers on it and asks you to compose a largest number from these numbers. The
resulting number is going to be your salary, so you are very much interested in maximizing
this number.

## Task:

Compose the largest number out of a set of integers.

## Input Format:

The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑛. The second line contains integers
𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛.

## Constraints:

1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100; 0 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 10<sup>3</sup> for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛.

## Output Format:

Output the largest number that can be composed out of 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛.

## Sample:

```
Input:
3
23 39 92

Output:
923923

```
